      "\n",
      "It's full of cliche's, it's action is routine and the effects whilst not bad, are not mind blowing either, there isn't much humour, but I have to say it is hard to hate a film that includes a dick joke which takes 20 minutes to pay off.\n",

      "\n",
      "It features two things I hate in movies, people eating noisily (when they'd never really eat at that moment) and when you see the back of someone's head (Vin Diesel for example) whilst he is talking, but what you can see of the side of his face, clearly does not match what he is saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 16 other people in my screening. They were mostly 20 or younger and spent a lot of time on their phones. Someone was even checking Facebook during a chase scene.\n",
      "One must assume that while the world is at the mercy of a global pandemic and every other high profile film release on record is being delayed, the producers behind Vin Diesel's 'Bloodshot' simply decided to say \"ahh the heck with it, just put the movie out and maybe we'll get a bump in market share.\"\n",

      "What's the worst that can happen? The film opens poorly, just as everyone already suspected it would?\n",
      "\n",

Man gets killed, brought back to life using cutting-edge technology making him stronger, faster, and more resilient? Check. Man uses newfound abilities to go on a revenge spree and avenge the murder of his wife? Check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps we should be lauding Vin Diesel for getting paid millions of dollars to play the same character for twenty years. The only problem is that him doing so forces film critics like me to watch his movies. Ray, his character in 'Bloodshot,' isn't interesting at all-either before or after his transformation. It's just Vin with a different three letter name, like a dozen other characters he's played recently, featuring the same brooding look and tough-guy mannerisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of going to the movie theater and potentially catching coronavirus-or worse, having to sit through 'Bloodshot'-stream some other similar (and better) flicks instead, such as 'Hardcore Henry' or 'Upgrade.'\n",

      "I simply run from Vin Diesel movies. F&F, XXX among other from this walking expressionless door they call an actor. Why? Because Vin Diesel's characters are all the same and they dont make any sense at all. Bloodshot was somekind of Robocop with Dredd... if booth were written by a desfunctional 15 year old boy with drug abuse. Okay, Robocop isn't that reference of perfect plot and development, but it was okay. This one here, however, we can't take no advantage from. The plot is Just a compilation of Hollywood action movies clichés from start to finish. The redemption of a A-Class American soldier who has no Family, no Friends, no one to miss him, so, thank that he has nothing to loose when te gets enhanced after death by a megalomaniac scientist who controls the movie heroe's every step. I mean...really?? Hollywood screenwriters have nothing left to come up with?? Thats sad at least. Special and visual effects are full of failures . The CGI is mediocre (to save adjectives). The sound mixing and editing was poorly developed, we dont feel the imerssion we should expect from a high action movie. Bloodshot saves himself for having a little bit more of 100 minutes length. More than that and I would certainly commmit suicide if Vin Diesel came with another super hero (una) effective quote. This movie is a total disgrace, please, dont loose your time or Money.\n",
      "It works on a basic level of action spectacle, but really doesn't offer anything in the story department that we haven't come to know with these revenge anti hero films. Vin Diesel is as standard as he usually is and doesn't make the character interesting either. I'll just sum it up and say this is just a throwaway action film with some cool sequences but overall you will feel like you've seen it already.\n",

The story had some good elements which could have made for a great movie. It just seems unfinished. I would not go and see it at the movies, its not worth the money.\n",

      "This is going to be a biased review ! Plain and simple ! I have never been and never will be a fan of Vin Diesel.....he simply cant act !! He is not an actor , he is like a stuntman that has got lucky and been forced into the public spotlight to be made into a star. He is not even a good action film actor............to me thats people like Tom Cruise , Liam Neeson and Keanu Reeves...............so your more than welcome to stop reading and downvote or whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nether the less I was going to give this film a try !! Try and throw all biases and pre conceived notions out before viewing it...........however it was very quick that I saw this was gonna be pretty dreadful........strangely though coming out of it I do think that the whole concept of the film, even though its not original in anyway, there is something interesting about it. All this film needed was better talent and quality infront of the camera..............and oh writing the script as well.\n",

      "Lastly oh what was that guy doing, Lamorne Morris...........I know he was probably told to act like that but just so spine numbingly awful at times, so cliched and stereotyped..........laughable..........he might be a good actor I'm not going to judge him for this film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah no I forgot Toby Kebbell..............wow has hollywood been desperately trying to make him a star , bless him...........I don't know I like the guy but he just gets involved in the wrong projects...........I think he an act but he is just plain weird in this film...............\n",

      "Strangely as I mentioned earlier there was promise with this idea of the main character and the story. All it needs is better actors , a better script , more serious tone and less humour.................you might just have something !?!? Unfortunately though we were given this pile of garbage in 2020........yes in 2020 films like this are still being made......I'm obviously in the minority as to why because I just don't see the appeal of dumb , easy , cliched and stereotyped stories/characters in a action film..........Its 30% out of 100 its pretty bad, only the CGI and the action scenes save it from being disastrous.........I just don't know anymore, can someone explain to me why stuff like this is popular ?!??!\n",
